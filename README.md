Web Marketing
Keyword and SEO research
At the beginning of the project, I sat down and documented all of the keywords associated with The Tavern, in order to try and improve my SEO rating as much as possible. To start this process, I began by noting down all the general keywords associated with my website:

* Dungeons and Dragons
* D&D
* TTRPG
* D20
* Dice
* Dnd Dice
* TTRPG Dice
* Dungeon and Dragons gifts

Next, I drilled these down into more specific long and short tail keywords:

* D&D
* D&D Dice
* Dungeons and Dragons
* Dimension 20
* Critical Role
* TTRPG
* TTRPG Dice
* Gift ideas for D&D fans
* Gift ideas for Dimension 20 fans
* Gift ideas for Critical Role fans
* Gift ideas for TTRPG fans
* Dice roller
* Dice bag
* Resin dice
* Acrylic dice
* Gemstone dice
* D&D accessories
* TTRPG accessories
* Best TTRPG dice

I also used Googles search bar to help me find related search phrases that users could be looking for, and I also used wordtracker.com to complete two free searches to find similar competition keywords at the time of searching.

After further consideration, I removed a number of these long and short tail keywords as they were either too competitive or would be too general for my purposes. My final list therefore became the following:

* D&D
* D&D Dice
* Dungeons and Dragons
* TTRPG
* TTRPG Dice
* Gift ideas for D&D fans
* Gift ideas for TTRPG fans
* Dice roller
* Dice bag
* Resin dice
* Acrylic dice
* Gemstone dice
* D&D accessories
* TTRPG accessories
* Best TTRPG dice
* Best Dnd Dice

Following this, I developed a content strategy which would help me align my requirements with the project I built:

* Easy navigation and search functionality to find specific products
* Secure and straightforward checkout process
* Fast answers to standard questions

* Clear sign posted opportunities to sign up to the mailing list

* Footer links to important information such as FAQs and contact information
* 404 page for broken pages

Marketing Strategies
As part of the building the website, I considered what The Tavern would use for marketing techniques, and came up with the following:

Who?
The Tavern's primary users are people who are already enganging with TTRPG and D&D games, as the items they sell are for use at the table itself. These could be people who virtually play TTRPG/D&D but it is more likely that these are people who meet and play games in physical spaces and therefore have a need for dice, dice rollers and dice bags

What online platforms do they use?
TTRPG and D&D has a large presence online already, particularly on Instagram, Tik Tok and Discord. If they were focussing on paid for marketing/influencer marketing, I would suggest they focus on these platforms.

What do they need?
D&D and TTRPG players are typically looking for communities, as both games are really considered to just be elaborate storytelling told in groups of friends. Therefore I would focus any marketing on this aspect of community and togetherness, as well as sharing funny memes about D&D, TTRPG tips and tricks for the table, and other fun aspects such as lore from Baldurs Gate. 

Sales and Discounts? 
As The Tavern is a small business, I would only advocate that they do sales seasonally rather than all the time, or in line with important events within the D&D community that The Tavern could piggyback of, such as season finales of Dimension 20 or Critical Role. 

Goals of the Business
The ultimate goal of The Tavern is to sell D&D accessories, but also to build a community of D&D and TTRPG fans

Budget
The Tavern do have a small marketing budget, however I would personally suggest to them that the rely on organic marketing rather than paid for marketing. You can often find that it is the outsiders and the misfits that drift towards D&D and TTPRG and those people can be especially cynical and shrewd about paid for marketing. After all reputation takes a lifetime to build and seconds to shatter.
